{/* <h1>How to use the BitCar platform</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Get an ethereum wallet and choose a software provider</h2>
<p>In order to purchase fractions of a car and interact with the platform, you will need to bring your own wallet, and one of the following software wallet providers.
    We do not provide a new wallet for you. For security reasons you will have to create one yourself and import it into one of these providers:
</p>
<ul className="wallet-providers">
    <li><a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/" target="_blank">MEWconnect</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://trustwallet.com/" target="_blank">Trust Wallet</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Unlock your software wallet</h2>
<p>Before you can register as a member, buy an interest in a car or vote on the platform, you will need to unlock your software wallet. 
    NOTE: We do not recommend having your wallet unlocked when you are just browsing the platform. Unlock it when you need to interact
    with the platform, then lock it again.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>We highly recommend the use of a hardware wallet. For more information and to buy one, visit one of these providers:</p>

</ul> */}
